# Verified CDCL Data Structures
Arjun Bhamra and Cameron Hoechst

As a part of our 8803 Special Topics course on SAT/SMT Solvers, we are aiming to create a verified set of data structures for use in the CDCL SAT Solver algorithm.
The data structures we intend to focus on are:
1. Conflict/Implication Graph
2. (Conflict) Clauses
3. Partial (Learned) Clause Database
4. Assignment Trail

Later on, we may begin leveraging these data structures to implement CDCL properly.
